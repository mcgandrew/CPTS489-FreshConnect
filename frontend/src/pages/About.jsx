          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Fresh Connect was born from a simple idea: to create a bridge between 
            small-scale local farmers and community members seeking fresh, sustainably 
            grown food. We believe that everyone deserves access to nutritious, 
            locally-produced food, and that small farms deserve fair compensation 
            for their hard work and dedication.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our platform aims to strengthen local food systems, reduce food miles, 
            and foster connections between producers and consumers in the Palouse region.
