# CPTS489-FreshConnect
This website was made for CPTS-489 at WSU Pullman.
FreshConnect is an online marketplace that connects small-scale farmers, local artisans, and eco-conscious consumers. Drawing inspiration from popular farmerâ€™s market concepts, the platform offers fresh produce, homemade goods, and other region-specific items.
By focusing on local products, our project aligns with the current demand for transparency, quality, and sustainable sourcing.
